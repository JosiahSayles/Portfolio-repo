Creating a new Portfolio website for myself utlilizng JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS and tailwind CSS styling.
I want to display myself as a technical professional, showcasing all my current and previous technical projects, while also
giving insight about my personality outside of tech. Giving employers, networkers, and collegues a clearer picture as to what I
am about and who I am!
